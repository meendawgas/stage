FOLLOW ME

Now get down on your knees
There's no one to speak
Except me me me

Follow me

You better close your eyes
Take this moment with ease
I'll smash everyone

Who tries to sneak in or tease

I'll smash them

You hear me?

Now please

Follow me

All stars are spinning around you
They got down quite a bit lower because of you
They see where's the real power

In deed

You're my stellar lover

Move

Feel that groove

Follow me

If you got a bit stark just act
It's like a movie anyway right?
Let's choose our roles from inside

But keep looking around on site

You see me?

Follow me

You might face my perishing rage
As I'm for to long locked in a cage
Now after ages scales have evened out

It allows me to reach a key and get out

Would you help me?

Follow me

Even if I'm speaking with void
My chords are ready to be worn
My sunshine you are my world

I'll become the one whom you where looking for

I'll roll my ball till you'll come

My Trust Is in You

I will follow you
